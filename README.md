# spotify-shuffle

This is a PROOF OF CONCEPT web app that allows you to use natural language to describe a playlist. The app links ChatGPT and Spotify. It's hacked together as a POC. I host my instance on AWS so I can create fun playlists on the go. Try, "1980s hits that sound like 2010 indie." Or, "epic rock anthems with female vocalists."
